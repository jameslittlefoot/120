How do they resolve pull requests? Can you get a sense of how contributions are evaluated in this community? How is the community organized? How is the repository/project organized?

They resolve pull requests by a first come first serve basis. I can kind of get a sense based on the volume but it seems like a smaller community. The community
is organized via individual contributions which are sorted trhough by pull request. The project is organized by dated files and commits.
